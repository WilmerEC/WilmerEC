Hi! I'm Wilmer Cubillan, a very passionate and curious individual interested in the world and what composes it!
My main areas of study and interest is within technology, specially in C/C++, C#, and Java. As a kid, I have always been fascinated by the
magic behind technology which, I truly believe it is the closest thing to a superpower, allowing humanity to reach new heights like never before
in mankind's history.

Technology isn't my only passion though; I'm very passionate about photography & films too, specially of the natural world! I 
try to go out on my free time to national parks to take pictures of plants and animals. I'm also interested in all kinds of science (psychology, physics, 
chemistry, astronomy, etc...), politics, economics, human rights, and history. While I'm, by no means, a professional in the fields previously mentioned
(with the exception of programming), I still enjoy fun discussions about any topic.

I'm currently broadening my software skills in order to one day build the tools that will one day push humanity beyond its limits along with a team of equally passionate people! 

If you ever want to collab, don't hesitate to reach me at:

...with your name, field of work/study, and project idea.
