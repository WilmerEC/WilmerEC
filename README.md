Hi! I’m Wilmer Cubillan, a very passionate and curious individual interested in science, technology, the world and what composes it! My main area of specialty and interest is working with low-level systems; everything from the back-end of a website to the different modules of operating and embedded systems! As a kid, I have always been fascinated by the magic behind technology; if done right, it can the closest thing to a superpower humans can obtain! It can really be life changing in all sorts of environments: from our personal lives to our professional work.

I decided to specialize in low-level systems since it is the heart of what makes our society function today. Everything from operating systems to wearable technology to core modules of app stores/sites is what I really fight for; to develop tools that push the boundaries of what we already have in place. This is where my analytical and problem-solving thinking comes into play; There’s always a solution, even if it’s very small or against the odds. During my free time, I like to walk around nature and cities to take pictures of what catches my eyes, it gives life new angles and relaxes the mind to come back fresh to work. I’m also interested in all kinds of science (psychology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, etc…), politics, economics, human rights, and history. While I’m, by no means, a professional in the fields previously mentioned (with the exception of programming), I still enjoy fun discussions about any topic.

I'm currently broadening my software skills in order to one day build new state-of-the-art technologies alongside a team of equally passionate people! If you ever want
to collab, don't hesitate to reach me at:
